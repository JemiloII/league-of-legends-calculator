# league-of-legends-calculator
This is an open source League of Legends calculator. The goal of this project is to use the riot api to keep our calculator consistently up to date.

// Will be using data.future, which has been renamed to data.task for handling future data request.

// Todo: Document static-data/champion module, Create mocha test, then it's finished.
